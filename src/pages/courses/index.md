### Changing Your Truth

Adapted from a highly popular course Thomas taught at George Brown College in Toronto, this course synthesizes psychology and literary technique to help you write, and then rewrite, Your Big Story. Though Thomas is not a mental health professional, the emphasis is as much on the therapeutic, self-actualizing, and self-discovery aspects of expressing yourself as much as the final product of the writing. Drawing on contemporary psychological theory about how a major component of your personality is shaped by “self-defining life narratives” that you tell yourself (“A new Big Five: Fundamental principles for an integrative science of personality,” Dan McAdams and Jennifer Pals, 2006) and the growing trend over the last two decades of what the literary world calls “autofiction,” as well as a surprisingly deep look at what it can mean to "edit" a narrative, we look at what stories exactly we are telling ourselves about ourselves, and the very real and tangible possibility that you can change the story you tell yourself, and therefore your change your self, and life.

Drawing from selections of writing by MFK Fisher, Zadie Smith, Joan Didion, Eileen Myles, James Baldwin, Lucy Grealy, Jhumpa Lahiri, Kiese Laymon, and Matias Viegener, we will use a variety of writing and revising exercises, as well as techniques adapted from “reminiscence therapy,” to create a story of your life you may not otherwise have thought of.
